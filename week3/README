Here will be described tasks of week 3
task 1: Implement the functions declared in the header file 
You are given a header file sum_reverse_sort.h containing declarations of three functions.
You need to send a cpp file containing the definitions of these functions.
Functions must add two numbers, reverse the string, and sort the vector of numbers in ascending order, respectively. 

task 2: Implement the class declared in the header file 
You are given the phone_number.h header file containing the declaration of the PhoneNumber class. 
At the same time, the comments describe the behavior that is expected from the implementation of this class.
You need to send a cpp file with definitions of methods of the PhoneNumber class that implement the described behavior. 

task 3: Write a class declaration 
You are now given the complete definition of the Rectangle class.
Send the header file rectangle.h containing the declaration for the Rectangle class. 
This should be a complete header file that can be used in a large project. 
In particular, it should solve the problem of double inclusion.
